# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_HR_DATA

This HR dataset provides a detailed view of employee characteristics and performance, enabling the analysis of various factors that influence employee satisfaction, retention, and overall engagement. This project was successfully completed with the guidance of UNP( United Network of Professionals).
This data includes information such as compensation, job involvement, work-life balance, and personal details, which are essential for understanding the dynamics of employee attrition. By leveraging this dataset, I developed a Power BI dashboard that visualizes key trends and patterns, allowing for an interactive exploration of employee data. The dashboard highlights insights into employee turnover, department-specific trends, and factors affecting job satisfaction, helping HR teams make data-driven decisions regarding retention strategies and employee well-being. Through this analysis, I was able to identify critical areas that impact employee performance, such as compensation disparities, work-life balance, and departmental factors. The Power BI dashboard serves as a valuable tool for ongoing monitoring and decision-making, providing a user-friendly interface for HR managers to gain actionable insights and optimize workforce management practices. All the necessary files and dashboards have been uploaded on GitHUB for furtherÂ reference.
